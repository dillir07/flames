# flames
Flames game using VueJs

## Note:
There are obivious ways of calculating the flames result using various built-in functions or simple mathematical expressions using higher-order functions, I wanted to mimic the human way of calculation by counting. So, in for loop I used counters and if a flame character is striked out, this moves on to next one. So please be aware this is like desperate brute-force approach.

Please do note that this is a tryout first kind of project with Vue, I didn't even use Components.
